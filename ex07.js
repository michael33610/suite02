/*

    Current Time

    Write a function "displayCurrentTime" that displays, each seconds, the current time infinitly;

    If the actual time is 10:30:08

    The script displays:

    10:30:09
    10:30:10
    10:30:11
    10:30:12
    10:30:13
    10:30:14
    ...

    One line each seconds.

    Tips:
    setTimeout

    Write your own tests !
